# Description
Joining multiple tables together using a key customer_id. The goal here is to find the top 5 users and location that spend money with RockBuster. This required multiple joins. Below shows the steps to find that answer.

1. Adding country column to our customer count

SELECT D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
From customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10

2. Adding the city column to our customer count and country columns

SELECT C.city, D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
From customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id WHERE D.country IN('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Phillipines','Indonesia','Turkey')
GROUP BY C.city, D.country
ORDER BY customer_count DESC

3. Adding first and last_name, and total_paid to our existing colums. 
SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name,
A.last_name,
C.city,
D.country,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
From customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id Inner JOIN payment E on A.customer_id = E.customer_id WHERE C.city IN('Aurora','Pingxiang','Sivas','Dhule(Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki','Xintai','Adoni','Celaya','Nezahualcyotl','Atlixco') 
GROUP BY 
A.customer_id,
C.city,
D.country ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
